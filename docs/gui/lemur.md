At the core of the Nostr Game Engine ui module, there is **Lemur**, a sophisticated GUI toolkit developer for jMonkeyEngine.
While the wrappers provided by NGE are often sufficient for most use cases, you can also use Lemur directly for more advanced needs.

!!! note
    Lemur is GUI toolkit for making user interfaces in jMonkeyEngine applications. It supports standard 2D UIs as well as fully 3D UIs. The modular design allows an application to use all or some of it as needed or even to build a completely new custom GUI library on top.
